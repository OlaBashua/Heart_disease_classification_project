# Heart_disease_classification_project
Machine learning  Capstone Course project on heart disease classification
## Project outline
  ## Objective
 - (I developed a machine learning model that analyzes patients' medical attributes and risk factors to determine if they are susceptible to a heart attack. )

## Tasks

### Data Analysis
- Import the dataset  
- Get information about the dataset ( mean, max, min, quartiles, etc) 
- Find the correlation between all fields
  
### Data Visualization
- Visualize patients with and without heart disease  
- Visualize the age and heart disease of patients  
- Visualize the correlation between features using a heat map  

### Logistic Regression
- Build a simple logistic regression model  
- Evaluate accuracy using the confusion matrix  

### Decision Tree
- Build a decision tree model  
- Evaluate accuracy using the confusion matrix  
- Visualize the decision tree  

### Random Forest
- Build a Random Forest model  
- Evaluate accuracy using the confusion matrix  
- Visualize the model  

### Select the Best Model
- Compare confusion matrices  
- Print classification reports  
- Calculate Recall, Precision, and F1 scores  
- Visualize confusion matrices  
-  Select the best model based on the accuracy

 ## Technical Skills
In this project, I utilized a range of technical skills and tools to successfully accomplish the tasks:

- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Model Evaluation: Scikit-Learn's metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy score, etc.)
- Graph Visualization: To visualize Decision Trees and Random Forests
These tools allowed me to efficiently process, analyze, visualize,  and model the heart disease dataset.
